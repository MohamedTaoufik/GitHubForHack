## 1. What is Git?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

Code of Conduct
TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that
makes you uncomfortable at an MLH Member Event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or
inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a MLH representative or event organizer makes
you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.
Major League Hacking (MLH) stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has
the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to
gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
social class, economic status, veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but
not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading,
doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is
making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to
stop doing it.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, MLH staff, and anyone else participating
in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should
not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the
event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MLH may take any action it deems
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility
for reimbursement or refund of any type.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
concerns, please contact MLH using the reporting procedures defined below.
MLH representatives can help participants contact campus security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions in
relation to the event, hackathon-related social events, and on hackathon supplied
transportation.
